# Predict Parkinson's Disease score using Supervised Learning (Regression task)

## Introduction

The unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) is used to follow the progression of a person's Parkinson's disease.

It is very important to monitor this quantity over time as clinicians and scientifics use it to provide adequate cares regarding the stage of the disease, or to measure benefits from the therapy.

The goal of this project will be to predict the total UPDRS and motor UPDRS of a patient using a non-invasing method.

## Dataset

The dataset used here is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.

The dataset can be found in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons+telemonitoring and is taken from -- _A Tsanas, MA Little, PE McSharry, LO Ramig (2009), 'Accurate telemonitoring of Parkinsonâ€™s disease progression by non-invasive speech tests', IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering_ --

## Method

We'll divide our project into 4 steps:
1. Problem Description
2. Data Analysis and Preparation
3. Modelling and Evaluation 
4. Conclusion

Instead of just trying algorithms and see which perform best, we'll try to understand which algorithm is best suited for this problem by exploring our data.
